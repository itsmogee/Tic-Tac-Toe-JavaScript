# Tic Tac Toe Game in Javascript

## What is this ?

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in JavaScript as part of the
[Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Javascript path.

The goal of this project is to use as little global code as possible. To get
used to using factory functions inside an IIFE (module pattern) so it cannot be
reused to create additional instances.
